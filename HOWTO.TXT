Install Windows XP SP3 via RIS from Linux
=========================================

Requirements:

- debian assumed, but any linux should work, and windows too
- atftpd
- udhcpd or other dhcp server
- samba
- a winxp sp3 iso
- (download script included) ris-linux, for needed tools and patches and the BINL server
- (download script included) LAN drivers from driverpacks.net, or windows drivers from the winxp iso, or both

Preparation:

- run get-ris-linux to download the rislinux package
- run patch-atftpd to patch atftp with patch from rislinux
- adduser tftp, which will also create /home/tftp where we'll put our boot files
- edit /etc/default/atftpd adding "--user=tftp --group=tftp /home/tftp" to the OPTIONS variable
- grab a winxp iso and fix the winxp.iso symlink to point to it
- run mount-winxpcd to mount that iso
- run extract-boot-files to extract boot files from the iso
- run patch-ntldr to patch ntldr for netbooting
- run get-lan-drivers to download the lan drivers from driverpacks.net via bittorrent
- run extract-lan-drivers to extract downloaded driver files into the inf and drivers
  directories respectively
- now is a good time to add more ethernet drivers if you need to, eg. I had to download the drivers
  for my Realtek GigE card from Realtek, others would not work; after you download your drivers, put any
  .inf files in the inf dir, and all other files (.sys, .dll, etc.) in the drivers dir
- run build-drivers-database to build nics.txt and drivers.cache by parsing the inf files from the inf dir
- run build-mini-binlsrv to build the mini-binl server that will tell windows about network drivers when it asks
- run copy-winxp-files to copy the i386 dir from the winxp cd along with the contents of the drivers dir
- configure samba to share /home/tftp/winxp as the "reminst" share; take a look at smb.conf.sample for that
- copy winnt.sif.sample to /home/tftp/winnt.sif and change the the network paths in there to point to your share
- run fix-tftproot-perms to make /home/tftp read-only for the tftp user under which atftp runs, very important!
- configure your dhcp server for bootp: in addition to specifying an ip range to lease,
  you need to specify the the boot-file dhcp option, which in this case is "startrom.n12"

Installation:

- restart samba, dhcpd and atftpd.
- run ./mini-binlsrv start to start the mini-binlr server.
- configure client's bios for pxe booting and reboot it.

Notes:

The preparation process is mostly captured in scripts. Just run (and possibly edit
to configure) the scripts in whatever order. The scripts call dependent scripts automatically and they
don't do the same thing twice. So in case of error, you have to remove the effects of the script
in order to run it again, eg. you have to remove the drivers dir manually to be able to extract
the drivers again.

When it comes to getting the drivers, you can also get them from the winxp iso itself,
by running extract-winxp-drivers.

If using pxelinux:
- symlink startrom.n12 to startrom.0 (pxelinux makes assumptions based on file extension)
- add a menu entry to /home/tftp/pxelinux.cfg/default with the line "kernel startrom.0"
